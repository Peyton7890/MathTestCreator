 Two Python modules for generating and managing calculus problems. The first module, CalcProblemGenerator.py, creates various types of calculus problems, including derivatives, integrals, and advanced topics. The second module, TestGenerator.py, compiles these problems into a customizable calculus test and generates a PDF document of the test along with its solutions.
